# Dataset Column Descriptions

This guide describes the columns for the three training history CSV files distributed to teams: `link_traffic_history.csv`, `link_telemetry.csv`, and `link_incident_history.csv`.

---

## 1. `link_traffic_history.csv`
Used to train the **congestion-prediction** model.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `link_id` | String | Unique identifier of the interplanetary link (e.g., `Aegis-Boreas`). |
| `tick` | Integer | The snapshot index. |
| `load_units` | Float | The amount of simulated traffic load currently on the link. |
| `load_ratio` | Float | The ratio of load to capacity (`load_units / capacity_units`). Ranges from `0.0` to just under `1.0`. |
| `status` | String | The link status. `"ok"` under normal conditions; `"saturated"` if `load_ratio` meets or exceeds `SATURATION_LOAD_RATIO` (0.90 by default), indicating a link failure. |
| `observed_latency_ms` | Float | The actual measured latency on the link (empty/null if the link is saturated/failed). |

---

## 2. `link_telemetry.csv`
Used to train the **trust/reliability** model.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `link_id` | String | Unique identifier of the interplanetary link. |
| `tick` | Integer | The snapshot index. |
| `self_reported_latency_ms` | Float | The latency reported by the link itself. Can be manipulated/discounted if the link is compromised, or contain normal reporting noise if honest. |
| `measured_latency_ms` | Float | The actual ground-truth latency experienced on the link during that tick. |

---

## 3. `link_incident_history.csv`
Used to train the **targeting-risk** model.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `link_id` | String | Unique identifier of the interplanetary link. |
| `tick` | Integer | The snapshot index. |
| `traffic_share` | Float | This link's slice of total interplanetary traffic at that tick (0 to 1). Sums to 1.0 across all active links in a given tick. |
| `jammed_flag` | Boolean | `True` if the link was successfully disrupted/jammed during this tick; `False` otherwise. |
